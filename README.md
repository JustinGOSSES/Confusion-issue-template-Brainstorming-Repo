# Confusion-issue-template-Brainstorming-Repo
A place to put thoughts around a template focused on points of confusion in order to promote issues and PR to improve docs.

Often times there are gaps in READMEs or Docs that confuse new users or lengthen developers onboarding to a project. 
There's a tendency for these deficiences to end up in issues and pull requests as they are oftne framed in terms of user failings or a standard part of trying to use a project for the first time. If these points of confusion were presented more obviously to maintainers, they'd often be glad to reduce these points of confusion. 

<b>An issue template specificly devoted to areas of confusion might be one way to improve reporting of confusion aspects of their repo to maintainers</b>
